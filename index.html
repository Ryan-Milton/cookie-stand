      <h6 id="disclaimer">
        Happiness not guaranteed or expected. <br />It's cookies that look and taste like salmon.<br /> I don't know why everyone is buying them. <br /> Actually it's probably the copius amount of cocaine in the frosting that keeps bringing them back.<br /> According to the Surgeon General, women should not eat Pat's Salmon Cookies during pregnancy because of the risk of your unborn child stealing all your delicious cookies and leaving you with none.<br /> Consumption of Pat's Salmon Cookies impairs your ability to think rationally about anything other than eating more Salmon Cookies, and may cause health and financial problems if consumed in large quantities.
